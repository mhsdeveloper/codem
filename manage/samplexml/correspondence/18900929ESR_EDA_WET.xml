						<salute>Dear Mr. Atkinson,</salute>
					</opener>
					<p>I will answer some of your questions soon - just now the inroad of new &amp;
						old students is overwhelming &amp; I have no brains left after planning
						courses for all sorts of people.</p>
					<p>I copied your letter &amp; sent to Mrs Abel &amp; here is an extract from
						hers received in the same mail. The food question will be the question
						inside of five years &amp; you may well be proud of having been a
						pioneer</p>

					<note xml:id="l_18900929ESR_EDA-fn-1"><p> Written in Ellen Richards’s Hand,
							copied from Mrs. Abel’s Letter--><lb/>Extract from Mrs Abel</p>
						<p>Letter of Sept 14.</p>
						<p>Appropos of a letter that has come to me asking for anything that will
							tell our readers how they can obtain more nutritious and less expensive
							food my husband offers this suggestion, That many classes of Americans
							must learn to spend more rather than less proportionally to other
							outgoes on proper nourishment especially for skillful preparation and
							variety, that there is too general a feeling that if hunger is satisfied
							for the time that is all sufficient and all saved beyond what is clear
							gain. He feels sure that explains many cases of defficient vigor and
							that in our artificial and <pb n="2"/> brain and nerve wearing life we cannot afford to despise
							high art in cookery and even the many course dinner and on these grounds
							he defends wine and beer at meals. He has met a great many Americans in
							the last year and he thinks most of them look underfed. Some who were
							going to take the Constantinople trip and were buying no end of trinkets
							were horrified at spending more than a mark for dinner. He took one of
							them in hand and made him feed up as you did Miss Palmer and with the
							best results especially in the quality of his work.</p>
