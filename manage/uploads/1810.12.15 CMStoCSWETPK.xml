<p>I couldnot resist a certain impulsive motion towards my pen, when I heard that Gen’l ^W[hiton]^ {{1}} was going this Evening, &amp; I involuntarily began to address my dear Charles-- I cannot say that I should not have done it with malice prepense, but the fact is I did it without any prepense at all. If I do not write more than ten lines, &amp; those not worth the reading, forgive me dear Charles, […] in consideration of an intolerable headache [&amp;] stupidity. [&amp;] Oh I am no philosopher. I deny the doctrine that pain is no Evil, &amp; hold that an effect must follow a cause, &amp; that if I have a headache, I must have a heartache too -- . I presume our friend Mrs. Forbes has long before this dispelled the “dark clouds” that shrouded her purpose, &amp; made you all stare &amp; gape with amazement-- I think we shall soon get so accustomed at Stockbridge to the most wonderful wonders that the world ever wondered at that they will be no more strange to us than the rising and setting of the Sun-- We will write a new play which shall annihilate the separation of the rival Mothers &amp; the rival Queens, and call it the rival Strangers. <space/><pb n="2"/> And if you please dear Charles we will have an under plot. [W] There shall be a young man in all the pride of self confidence conquered at the very moment that he is toasting his security against the whole artillery of a young Lady’s charms-- You must supply me with the detail of incidents, &amp; I will furnish the denouement. -- --</p>
<p>My feelings are all still interested for Mrs. Morgan -- -- -- -- I must take leave of you my dear Brother, for I have scarcely time to write a few lines to Eliza--</p>
