<p>{{SALUTE}} My dear Mr Atkinson </p>
<p>I think you are very rash in your statements as you sometimes are. In the end you are generally right but there is sometimes a period of tribulation before it is proved.</p>
<p>I judge that you were fairly well pleased with the Rumford Kitchen. I leave Boston at 715 tomorrow Monday the 25th for Chicago to stay until it is all over. I suppose it will be about six weeks, the longest time I have been away for 7 years. If you have anything to say that you can not </p>
<p>{{PB}}<lb/>as well write I will try to get in to see you if you send me word, but I shall be extremely busy with the opening day of the term, and I have no doubt you gave Miss Daniells &amp; Miss Wentworth all the good advice you had.</p>
<p>{{CLOSE}} Sincerely yours,</p>
