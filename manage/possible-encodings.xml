						<salute>Dear Bob, </salute>
					</opener>
					<p> I wish you were all to be here to take <damage/> in our good cheer, and to
						make for us truly a festival of the spirit<ptr n="1"
							target="JIL2018-12-03-fn-1"/> -- In our fervent thanksgiving we shall
						remember the dear Brothers and Sister, whose love blesseth us all the year,
						and whose health and prosperity are among the most valued of our heavenly
						Father’s gifts. The thought of you may cost me a tear—but there will be no
						bitterness in it --</p>
					<p>Bitterness is, like winter,<lb/>Not sweet. But Bittersweet<lb/>Tastes great a
						la mode.</p>
					<p>Your last letter surprised me a little, -- There is a <unclear/> promised to
						those that ‘wait’ you know, and I expect to realize it, for I shall be
						perfectly passive -- <pb n="2"/> Sister Frances is still in Albany -- I
						expect her down tomorrow <space/>.</p>
					<p> It should not be “small things” dear Robert that render a woman worthy of
						you.</p>
					<space type="block"/>
					<p> Aunt was sitting in her kitchen, when Sue<ptr n="2"
						target="JIL2018-12-03-fn-2"/> came in. <persRef ref="smith-jill-1801">Fortune</persRef> was frying some liver for
						his supper—Sue took up a fork in her ‘sans ceremo1ie’ manner and would have
						shared with him. Fortune who didn’t know her and only knew she was crazy
						<add/> snatched the fork from her and told he would stick it
						into her if she did not keep her distance. At this, with the quickness of a
						Maniac great speed she seized a <supplied>hammer?</supplied> and raising her
						arm as if to knock his brains out said ‘Are you ready to die—He had just
						been present at the slaughter of the Colion.' <pb n="3"/></p>
					<p> Cynthia is here and sends her love to you remember me aff’y to all, and tell
						Theodore and Egbert we all wish very much they were to join us at our
						Thanksgiving-- God bless you all my dear Robert --Believe me as ever </p>
					<closer>your ever faithful servant, your ever faithful servant, <signed>thine
							Jim</signed>
