++++ POINT OUT FEATURES OF OUR SIZE


http://www.josephsmithpapers.org


----  No very direct list of recipients, names

++++ browse by doc type categories: need config or UI for mapping @type at doc-level to display names
++++ doc viewer and nav
++++ transcriptions: show lb even when very narrow, otherwise hide's and just does the break
                                popups for names with brief bio info
++++ related materials:
     need a way to assign additional HTML nodes/content to views; or have lists from metadata as plugin to WP/SilverStripe
